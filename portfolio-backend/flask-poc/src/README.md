**1. Create a virtual environment:**

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python3 -m venv .venv` and press Enter. This creates a virtual environment named `.venv` within your current directory. Virtual environments isolate project-specific dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects or system-wide Python installations.

**2. Activate the virtual environment:**

   - Type `. .venv/activate` and press Enter. This activates the virtual environment, ensuring that subsequent package installations are contained within it.

**3. Install required packages:**

   - Type the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:

      - `pip install Flask`: Installs Flask, a popular Python web framework for building web applications.
      - `pip install peewee`: Installs peewee, a lightweight object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions in Python.
      - `pip install dependency-injector`: Installs dependency-injector, a dependency injection framework for managing dependencies and code structure in Python applications.

**4. Repository pattern**

   - This proof-of-concept (POC) adheres to a layered architecture that separates application concerns for better organization and maintainability.
   - **Layers can include:**
     - **Repository Layer:** Handles interactions with the data source (database in this case), encapsulating data access logic within concrete repository implementations.
     - **Service Layer:** Provides business logic and domain-specific operations. It interacts with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.
     - **Controller Layer (or API Layer):** Acts as the entry point for user requests (API calls, web requests). It interacts with services to orchestrate business logic and may format data for the presentation layer.
   - This layered approach promotes loose coupling, allowing you to modify individual layers without significant impact on others. It also improves code clarity and testability.
